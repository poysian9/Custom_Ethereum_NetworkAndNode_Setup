## What is Lendonomy?

Lendonomy is a Norwegian-based Fintech Company which provides a peer-2-peer (P2P) "social lending" platform, specifically targetted at young adults. Dubbed "AirBnB for money", Lendonomy is a mobile app which combines social networking, augmented reality  and gamification in an attempt to motivate young people to support each other financially by sharing money all over the world!

Users exist within commonly shared pools of money where they are able to simultaneously borrow and lend money. First time users concur limits to these amounts however a 'Trust Score' is accrued onto the ethereum network via smart contracts. The Trust Score is a universally recognisable score which is akin to a credit score, allowing users to better their score and improve lending rates.

Lendonomy also communicates with open banking api's where a default on a loan can be reflected in the users real life credit score.

## Why this matters.

First of all, this is a great financial service which looks to serve young people experience all kinds of financial hardships. A social network which keeps track of your trustworthiness is a great way to teach young adults how to be appropriate with their money while thinking to help others. Since this service is also attached to users bank data a link is establised between the two and each score effects the other, keeping users accountable.

Secondly, and the part which is not brought to attention in most articles is the use of smart contracts to upload transactional/lending data onto the Ethereum network. This creates a permanent and immutable record of the users lending and borrowing data which is used to calculate the Trust Score. This will become a way to translate your 'credit score' to other countries, should you move.

## Keep your eye out
